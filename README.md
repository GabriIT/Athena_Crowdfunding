Parameter of the crowd-funding action are following

All members can become jurors, but they need to pledge 300 ADA, add a description of their experience and motivation to be jurors. Additionally they should select one or more category they think they are skilled to fulfill the jobs. My tentative list is:  blockchain, coding, electronics, food mechanics, management, automotive, administrative, writing, art, leisure, tooling,  finance

-M – Product assesment by subscribers 3 months after product delivery (succedding or not shall affect CAS of promotion team) → subscribers need to classify 1-5 (top) the product adding an explanation about  the score
-N – Selecting if crowd-funding participants are 'private', that is promoter team accept only participants they desire to invite (exclusive Club) [field: promoter has to fill in selecting one of 2 options]
